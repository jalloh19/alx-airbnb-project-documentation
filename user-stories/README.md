# User Stories Documentation

## Overview
This document translates the interactions from the **Use Case Diagram** into actionable **User Stories**.  
Each story captures what a user wants to achieve and why, guiding backend feature development in a user-centric way.

## Purpose
User stories serve as the foundation for:
- Defining **backend features** and **API endpoints**.  
- Structuring **acceptance criteria** for testing and validation.  
- Aligning development efforts with **real user needs**.  


## Files
